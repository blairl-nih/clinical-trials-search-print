To compare the rate of ctDNA clearance in \"ctDNA detected\" patients treated with or without adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of stage IIA colon cancer. (Phase II)\r\nII. To compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) in \"ctDNA detected\" patients treated with or without adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of stage IIA colon cancer. (Phase III)\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To describe the prevalence of detectable ctDNA in patients with stage IIA colon cancer following surgical resection.\r\nII. To estimate time-to-event outcomes (overall survival [OS], recurrence-free survival [RFS], and time to recurrence [TTR]) by ctDNA marker status and treatment for patients with resected stage IIA colon cancer.\r\nIII. To estimate the rate of compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy and/or active surveillance for patients with resected stage IIA colon cancer.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To describe the association of quantitative ctDNA levels with time to event outcomes (RFS, OS, and TTR).\r\nII. To characterize genomic profiles associated with recurrence using a ctDNA assay in patients with resected stage IIA colon cancer.\r\nIII. To model the cost effectiveness of the use of ctDNA versus standard of care in this setting.\r\nIV. To evaluate performance of a ctDNA assay after incorporation of patient tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I (BLOOD STORED AND TESTED FOR ctDNA LATER): Patients undergo active surveillance.\r\n\r\nARM II (BLOOD TESTED FOR ctDNA AT BASELINE): Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.\r\n\r\nGROUP I (ctDNA DETECTED): At the discretion of the investigator, patients receive either oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1, leucovorin IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV bolus over 2-4 minutes on day 1 and then by continuous IV over 46-48 hours repeated every 14 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 repeated every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nGROUP II (ctDNA NOT DETECTED): Patients undergo active surveillance.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 months and then every 6 months for 2 years.",

A 'leaving group' is an atom or a group of atoms that is displaced as a stable species taking with it the bonding electrons. After displacement of the labile oxalate ligand leaving group, active oxaliplatin derivatives, such as monoaquo and diaquo DACH platinum, alkylate macromolecules, forming both inter- and intra-strand platinum-DNA crosslinks, which result in inhibition of DNA replication and transcription and cell-cycle nonspecific cytotoxicity. The DACH side chain appears to inhibit alkylating-agent resistance. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent. (NCI Thesaurus)Health professional",

Fluorouracil and its metabolites possess a number of different mechanisms of action.  In vivo, fluoruracil is converted to the active metabolite 5-fluoroxyuridine monophosphate (F-UMP); replacing uracil, F-UMP incorporates into RNA and inhibits RNA processing, thereby inhibiting cell growth.  Another active metabolite, 5-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-O-monophosphate (F-dUMP), inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), one of the four nucleotide triphosphates used in the in vivo synthesis of DNA.  Other fluorouracil metabolites incorporate into both RNA and DNA; incorporation into RNA results in major effects on both RNA processing and functions.

As a prodrug, capecitabine is selectively activated by tumor cells to its cytotoxic moiety, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) by both tumor cells and normal cells.  FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by reducing normal thymidine production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate for incorporation into the RNA strand.

Finding ctDNA in the blood means that there are very likely small amounts of cancer remaining after surgery that may not be detectable using other tests, such as medical imaging. Testing for ctDNA levels may help identify patients with colon cancer who benefit from receiving chemotherapy after surgery. It is not yet known whether giving additional treatment with chemotherapy after surgery to patients who test positive for ctDNA and are at low risk for cancer recurrence would extend their time without disease compared to the usual approach (active surveillance).",
