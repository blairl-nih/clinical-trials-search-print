To compare the overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) treated with ipilimumab-nivolumab followed by either nivolumab versus cabozantinib-nivolumab.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine progression free survival (PFS) of patients treated with nivolumab versus nivolumab-cabozantinib.\r\nII. To evaluate the 12-month complete response rate in patients treated with ipilimumab-nivolumab followed by cabozantinib-nivolumab versus ipilimumab-nivolumab followed by nivolumab (patients who have complete response [CR] and relapse before 12 months will not be counted as a CR at 12-months).\r\nIII. To evaluate the rates of discontinuing therapy at 1 year.\r\nIV. To compare objective response rates (ORR, assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 and Immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [iRECIST] criteria) for patients treated with ipilimumab-nivolumab followed by cabozantinib-nivolumab versus ipilimumab-nivolumab followed by nivolumab.\r\nV. To document the adverse event profile of ipilimumab-nivolumab followed by cabozantinib-nivolumab.\r\n\r\nBIOMARKER OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate biomarkers associated with exceptional responses in both arms (exceptional responses defined as CRs with treatment discontinuation at 12 months or 24 months).\r\nII. To evaluate whether baseline IL-6 is predictive of outcome in patients treated with cabozantinib-containing regimen.\r\n\r\nQUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To compare health-related quality of life at 18 months post-registration as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Kidney Symptom Index 19 (FKSI-19) between patients randomized to nivolumab (nivo) versus (vs) cabozantinib (cabo)/nivo.\r\nII. To compare health-related quality of life as assessed by the FKSI-19 between patients randomized to nivo vs cabo/nivo at other time points.\r\nIII. To compare patient-reported fatigue using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Fatigue between patients randomized to nivo vs cabo/nivo.\r\nIV. To compare quality-adjusted survival (overall survival x utility score assessed by EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire [EQ5D-5L]) between patients randomized to nivo vs cabo/nivo.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nINDUCTION: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nPatients with unconfirmed but clinical progression of disease (iuPD) receive cabozantinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days until further disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nPatients with unconfirmed CR (iCR) receive nivolumab IV between 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nPatients with non-CR/non-PD or iuPD are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM A: Patients receive nivolumab IV between 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nARM B: Patients receive nivolumab IV between 30-60 minutes on day 1 and cabozantinib PO daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.",

Nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated  immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function through the suppression of P13k/Akt pathway activation.

The addition of cabozantinib to the usual treatment may make it work better. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known how well the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab after initial treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab works in treating patients with renal cell cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.",

To assess the pathologic complete response rate (pathCR) rate following administration of neoadjuvant carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation therapy versus neoadjuvant carboplatin, paclitaxel, radiation therapy and nivolumab in patients with a resected locoregionally advanced esophageal or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.\r\nII. To assess the disease-free survival (DFS) following administration of adjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab versus adjuvant nivolumab in patients with a resected locoregionally advanced esophageal or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant treatment with carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation therapy with or without nivolumab.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To assess the overall survival (OS) following administration of adjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab versus nivolumab in patients with a resected locoregional esophageal or gastroesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant treatment with carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation therapy with or without nivolumab.\r\nII. To assess the disease free survival (DFS) following administration of neoadjuvant carboplatin, paclitaxel, and radiation therapy with or without nivolumab in patients with a locoregional esophageal or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma\r\nIII. To assess the toxicity associated with the administration of neoadjuvant nivolumab in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation therapy in patients with a locoregional esophageal or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.\r\nIV. To assess the toxicity associated with the administration of adjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab versus adjuvant nivolumab in patients with a resected locoregional esophageal or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant treatment with carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiation therapy with or without nivolumab.\r\n\r\nIMAGING OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine if the percent change in mean volumetric apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), measured from pre-treatment to mid-treatment, is predictive of pathCR in patients with a locoregional esophageal or gastroesophageal junctional adenocarcinoma undergoing chemo and chemoradiotherapy plus (+)/minus (-) nivolumab.\r\nII. To identify an optimal delta ADC cutoff in predicting pathCR.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: \r\n\r\nSTEP I: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. \r\n\r\nARM A: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) and paclitaxel IV once weekly and undergo radiation therapy once daily (Monday-Friday) beginning on day 1. Cycles repeat every week for up to 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nARM B: Patients receive carboplatin, paclitaxel, and radiation therapy as in Arm A. Patients also receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every week for up to 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nSTEP II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms following standard of care surgery. \r\n\r\nARM C: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nARM D: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm C and receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1, 4, 7, and 10. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.",

Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue.  This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent. (NCI Thesaurus)Health professional",

These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic.

Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may reduce the tumor size and the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. A combined treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy might be more effective in patients with esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who are undergoing surgery.",

      "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To estimate the adverse event profile of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) over the first six months of treatment, in non-small cell lung cancer patients who are 70 years of age or older and who are treated with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) +/- chemotherapy in a first-line setting.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To estimate overall survival.\r\nII. To describe patient quality of life during the treatment using the Linear Analogue Self-Assessment (LASA) questionnaire.\r\nIII. To explore whether Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) -derived risk score is able to predict rates of severe adverse events in older cancer patients who receive MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) or MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) + chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To describe patient fatigue level as measured with the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory  Short Form (MFSI-SF); exercise level using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTE); and other symptoms and concerns using the LASA questionnaires.\r\nII. To estimate time-to-treatment failure for single-agent MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) + chemotherapy in older patients.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIVE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate whether older patients who experience fatigue or other adverse effects would be correlated with a change of PD-L1 therapy-responsive T cell subset (i.e. CX3CR1+CD11ahighCD8+ T-cells) in their peripheral blood from baseline (prior to therapy) to post therapy. \r\nII. To determine the extent to which MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) demonstrates time dependent decrease in clearance in older adult patients (aged >= 70 years) with non-small cell lung cancer being treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. \r\nIII. To determine the intrapatient and interpatient variability in clearance in older adult (>= 70 years) patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy and when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy.\r\nIV. To preliminarily explore the correlation between pembrolizumab exposure (AUC) with observed immune related toxicities in this older adult (aged >= 70 years) patient population receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy and when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy. \r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.\r\n\r\nGROUP A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 or 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nGROUP B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles with pembrolizumab repeat every 21 or 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes, and carboplatin IV per institutional guidelines on day 1. Cycles with pemetrexed and carboplatin repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for up to 5 years after registration.",

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue.  This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent. (NCI Thesaurus)Health professional",

              "description": "A humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1) with potential immunopotentiating activity. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

      "brief_summary": "This trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that has come back (recurrent) and has spread to other places in the body (advanced). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy may shrink the tumor in older patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",
